        Human Trafficking and Sex Trafficking Mix Up

        By browsing the English produced media landscape, the conflation of human trafficking and sex trafficking appears to be a common occurrence. However, these two concepts are not identical.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        UNODC operates with terms such as "sex trafficking", "labour trafficking", and "trafficking in children" (UNODC, 2017) all of which are meant to describe specific types of human trafficking. By subscribing to this premise, sex trafficking is always human trafficking but human trafficking is not always sex trafficking. This construction naturally has to do with the development of the two terms in question.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        Some suggest that the term sex trafficking was coined by second wave feminists in the 1980s as a part of protests against the exploitation of women and girls in prostitution and pornography (Fairobserver, 2013). Others suggest that the incubation happened during the 1990s, also by anti-prostitution feminists, but that the word "trafficking" was closely coupled with the influx of women from collapsed Soviet Union to the United States (Newrepublic, 2015).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        During the 1980s and 1990s the 1950 International Convention was the main international authority on the matter of traffic in persons and the preamble prescribed that: "Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person [â€¦]" (UN Treaty Collection, 1951). Regardless of the exact time of origin, it would make conceptual sense (despite not being semantically accurate) to describe circumstances where act, mean and sexual exploitation, was present, as sex trafficking.

      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        From a purely conceptual point of view the rational choice would have been for the feminist movement(s) to adapt the legal term "traffic in persons". But in light of being a political movement, the rationale behind the creation of a rhetorical potent term such as "sex trafficking" seems pretty self-explanatory (fueling a political agenda) just as discussed in the case of white slave trade. During that time, the co-existence of "traffic in persons" and "sex trafficking" wouldn't necessarily have led to complications in the understanding of the two since they described the same phenomenon. In this case it wouldn't be a major issue if they got mixed up.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        The main reason why the conflation became a problem was due to the expansion of what constituted as human trafficking exploitation in the 2000 Palermo Protocol, which came to be understood as: "at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs" (UN Treaty Collection, 2000).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        This significant adjustment in the concept of human trafficking lead to the misalignment of human trafficking and sex trafficking (as a concept referring to the sexual exploitation of women), a juxtaposition, that otherwise would have been conceptually valid and hence way less confusing.
