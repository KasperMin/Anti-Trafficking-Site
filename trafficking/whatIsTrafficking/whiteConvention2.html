        <h4>
        The 1910 Conference International Conference on the White Slave Traffic
        </h4>
        It took 8 years before the non-binding draft convention from the 1902 conference got ratified, by 13 countries (Newman, 2013), at the 1910 International Convention for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic in Paris, which was the second of its kind. It went into force in 1912 (Allain, 2017).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        There were two reason why the 1902 Conference failed to provide a binding-text, the first being of a procedural nature concerning how the states would cooperate on criminal matters and the second was disagreements about defining when a girl was a minor and majority.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        Both issues got solved at the 1910 Convention and the minor age was set to 20, as a minimum standard, with the option for each State to raise the bar as they saw it fit. This example is illustrative of the challenges as it pertains to a common understanding of human trafficking in a modern-day context as legal divergences between Stats produces different interpretations of human trafficking. In the United Kingdom Treaty Series from the 1910 International Convention for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic, Article 1 and Article 2 defines white slave traffic as follows:

      <div class="menuTwoTextParaDefinition">

            "Whoever, in order to gratify the passions of another person, has procured, enticed, or led away, even with her consent, a woman or girl under age, with immoral purposes, shall be punished notwithstanding that the various acts constituting the offence may have been committed in different countries".
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            "Whoever, in order to gratify the passions of another person, has, by fraud, or by means of violence, threats, abuse of authority, or any other means of compulsion, procured, enticed, or led astray a woman or girl over age, for immoral purposes, shall also be punished, notwithstanding that the various acts constituting the offence may have been committed in different countries" (Allain, 2017).
