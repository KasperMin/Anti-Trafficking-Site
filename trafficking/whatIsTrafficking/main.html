          Jane was just 13 when she one day after school was approach by an old man who knew she had an unstable family life.  He began to offer her present and lifts, but soon he began to demand sexual acts as repayment. Over time, he started to pass Jane around to other men who forced her to have sex, take videos, pictures and drugs. This evolved into driving Jane across country to have sex with other groups of men. If she tried to object they would throw her out of the car while driving, break bits of her face, threaten her family, and they even attempted to cover her in petrol and set her on fire. This abuse went on for nine years (BBC, 2015).

        <div id="introText">
          This story is just one out of many human trafficking cases in the UK as revealed in a recent major official report conducted by the National Crime Agency (NCA). In a previous NCA report from 2016, trafficking in person in the UK was estimated to 10.000-13.000 victims (NCA, 2017). But these numbers are, according to the latest NCA report, only the top of the iceberg, and the estimated number of human trafficking victims grows exponentially with the amount of police operations launched to combat the problem (BBC News, 2017; Independent, 2017).

          The UK is a highly developed country and the 5th largest economy in the world (World Economic Forum, 2017). Yet, Human Trafficking, also referred to, by some, as modern slavery, is very much alive and kicking in the UK despite it being something that one might believe only existed in less developed countries or merely was a part of a past long gone. But nearly every country on the planet, whether it is rich or poor, Muslim or Christian, liberal or socialist, named New York or Katmandu, is in some way, shape or form affected by human trafficking (Bale, 2012; Shelly, 2010; UNODC, 2010).

        <div id="introText">
          The popular understanding of human trafficking, is that it has to do with victims getting transported from one locale to another, where they are trapped and sexually exploited, like in the example above. But that is actually what has come to be known as sex trafficking which is only one specific type of human trafficking. Human trafficking is an extremely complex phenomenon and it cannot be fully explained in one or two sentences. It means different things to different people in different contexts. It's meaning is shaped by history, political interests, international cooperation, media and of course by semantics.

        <div id="introText">
          In the following, I will dissect the concept human trafficking and attempt to explain what it means by looking at its etymology, semantics and how it has developed as an international legal instrument.
