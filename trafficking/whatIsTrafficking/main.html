            Jane was just 13 when she one day after school was approach by an old man, who knew she had an unstable family life.  He began to offer her present and lifts, but soon he began to demand sexual acts as repayment. Over time he started to pass Jane around to other men, who forced her to have sex, take videos, take pictures and take drugs. This evolved into driving Jane across country to have sex with other groups of men. If she tried to object they would throw her out of a car, break bits of her face, threaten her family, and they even attempted to cover her in petrol and set her on fire. This abuse went on for nine years (BBC, 2015).

            This story is just one out of many human trafficking cases in the UK as revealed in a recent major official report conducted by the National Crime Agency (NCA). In a previous NCA report from 2016, trafficking in person in UK was estimated to 10.000-13.000 victims (NCA, 2017). But these numbers are, according to the latest NCA report, only the top of the iceberg, and the estimated number of human trafficking victims grows exponentially with the amount of police operations launched to combat human trafficking (BBC News, 2017; Independent, 2017).

            UK is a highly developed country and the 5th largest economy in the world (World Economic Forum, 2017). Yet, Human Trafficking, also referred to as modern slavery, is very much alive and kicking in UK, despite it being something that one might believe only existed in less developed countries or merely was a part of a past long gone. But every country on the planet, no matter if it's rich or poor, Muslim or Christian, liberal or socialist, named New York or Katmandu, is in some way, shape or form affected by human trafficking.

          <div id="introText">
            The popular understanding of human trafficking, is that it has to do with victims getting striped of their basic human rights and sexually exploited by another individual who takes ownership over the trafficked victim for their own personal gains. But Human trafficking is an extremely complex phenomenon and it cannot be explained in one or two sentences. It means different things to different people in different contexts. It's meaning is shaped by history, political interests, media and of course by semantics.

          <div id="introText">
            In the following I will attempt to dissect the concept of Human Trafficking by looking at its etymology, it's political origin and its usage today. Since Human Trafficking also has been coined modern slavery, I will examine slavery and discuss how juxtaposing these two concepts make sense, and how it doesn't.
