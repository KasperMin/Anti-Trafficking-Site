        Human trafficking can be defined as: "the transportation or harbouring of an individual(s) by means of coercion or deceit for the purpose of labour or sexual exploitation". In my attempt to provide a short and "simple" human trafficking definition the result is an oversimplification - and even so, this definition is still very complex and not without its implications.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        This definition is a shortened version of the trafficking in persons' definition produced in the 2000 Palermo Protocol which has been criticized for its lack of ability (or will) to elaborate on what the different components such as "labour", "slavery" etc. precisely means. The same, in my opinion, valid criticism can of course be applied to the definition provided above.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        I will not attempt to respond to these critiques, nor do I deem myself qualified to do so, but merely point out that the abstract nature of not only of the definition as a whole, but also of each of its constituent concepts, makes it extremely challenging to provide a simple definition. Notwithstanding it's imperfections, we need to have at least some idea of what human trafficking means in order to discuss the concept and for that purpose a simple definition will suffice. Instead I will discuss how the lack of a precisely defined definition concurrently with national jurisdictions produces different understandings of human trafficking.

        <h4>
          Human Trafficking Means Different Things in Different Countries
        </h4>
        The meaning and usages of human trafficking diverges accordingly to the individuals or entities who use it whether that being the media, NGOs, academics, governments or international bodies, all of which interprets the language used to describe human trafficking (such as coercion, deceit etc.) differently.  The definition set in the 2000 Palermo Protocol seems to be the common standard used by these different agents. But despite the ostensibly convergence on an international level on a human trafficking definition, the reality paints a different picture.

        The challenge with human trafficking as an international legal concept is that the nature of human trafficking is actually transnational. This basically means, that once States have agreed to be bound by the 2000 Palermo Protocol, the power to decide how much of the provision they want to adapt and exactly how to define what legally constitutes as human trafficking, reside within each State (Allain, 2017).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        In China the criminal code on human trafficking is defined Article 240 as: "abducting and trafficking of women or children [â€¦] for the purpose of selling women and children" (TIP, 2017). This diverges from the international law as it doesn't tie forced labor and prostitution to the purpose of human trafficking. While there are other articles in place to address such types of exploitation in China, the definition on what constitutes human trafficking in China is different from that of international standard. Consequently, it is only considered to be human trafficking in circumstance where the purpose of buying or selling a person is involved, while situations where labour, sexual or other types of exploitation occurs, is not considered to be human trafficking.
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        In the 2011 "Directive on combating and preventing trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims", the European Union (EU) added to their definition of human trafficking that the purpose or exploitation also includes "begging" and "criminal activities" which applies to the 28 member states (European Commission, 2011).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        The result of the dichotomy between human trafficking as an international legal matter and a national legal matter, is that human trafficking means different things in different countries. Or as Jean Allain puts it "States speak to each in different languages: both literally, but also figuratively (red. trafficking)" (Allain, 2017).
