        United Nations: Suppression of the Traffic in Persons

      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        In 1949 the UN General Assembly approved the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. It went into force in 1951 and stated in the preamble of the resolution that:
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextParaDefinition">
        "Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community,
        Whereas, with respect to the suppression of the traffic in women and children, the following international instruments are in force […]" (UN Treaty Collection, 1951).
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        The "instruments in force" refers to the 1904 Agreement, the 1910 Convention, the 1921 Convention, the 1933 Convention, and also the League of Nations 1937 prepared draft Convention. These constituted the foundation for the consolidation and desirable alterations as it pertains to trafficking in persons in 1951 as Article 1 and Article 2 are defined:
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            "The Parties to the present Convention agree to punish any person who, to gratify the passions of another:
            (1) Procures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person;
            (2) Exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person."
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            "The Parties to the present Convention further agree to punish any person who:
            (1) Keeps or manages, or knowingly finances or takes part in the financing of a brothel;
            (2) Knowingly lets or rents a building or other place or any part thereof for the purpose of the prostitution of others. (UN Treaty Collection, 1949)"

        <h4>
          The 1902 Conference International Conference on the White Slave Traffic:
        </h4>
        Three years later this non-binding resolution was the basis of deliberation at the 1902 International Conference on the White Slave Traffic. It took place in Paris and had the primary objective of producing a draft convention which would be implemented and enforced in each of the attending States. The following definition of white slave trade was proposed:
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            "Severely punished will be any person who, to satisfy the passions of another, shall have procured, enticed or led astray, even with her consent, an underage girl, with immoral intent."
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            "Equally will be punished any person who by violence, threats, abuse of authority, compulsion or fraud will have procured, enticed, or led astray a woman or a girl over age, with immoral intent" (Allain, 2017).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextPara">
        Compared with the 1899 Conference, the definition suggested in 1902 explicitly divided women and girls into an underage (1) and an over age (2) category. Underage women and girls were defined as victims of slave traffic even if they hadn't been exposed to violence, threats etc. On the other hand, such measures had to be applied in order for over age women or girls to be considered as slave traffic victims. A further elaboration on the definition of what constitute the offence of white slave traffic was afforded on the basis of the 1899 definition:
      </div>
      <div class="menuTwoTextParaDefinition">
        "to procure is to is to invite or lead the woman or girl to become a prostitute; to entice is to take her away with or persuade her to follow; to lead astray is to remove her illegally from her surroundings. […] The offence is characterized by its continuity; the successive steps which it may entail take place either within the frontiers of one country alone or in several countries. There is no unity of place. This criminal traffic is international: the human body is traded in and treated as merchandize; the traffickers in it have their agencies, their depots, their correspondents, their export offices, and even their code" (Allain, 2017).
