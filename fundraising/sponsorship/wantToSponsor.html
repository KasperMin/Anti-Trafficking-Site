          When I started my work at Blossom my first order of business was to give the content on the organizations' website an overhaul. Since the website in many cases is the public's only way to make an impression of an organization, I believe it's extremely important to make sure that it signals passion, organization, and professionalism. To me, that means clear communication about who the organization is and why it exists. This must be conveyed in a clear, no jargon, language. A no-brainer is no typos, spelling errors and preferably grammatically correct down to the last comma.
          Most of the text that exists on the Blossom website today is my writing.

          It's more expensive for companies to recruit a new customer than to keep an existing one. Companies gladly pay large sums to achieve brand loyalty among their existing customer base. Satisfied and loyal customers tell others about their favorite brands. Brand loyalty important more than ever due to the proliferation of information and myriad of consumer options. Sponsoring an NGO's properties and causes keeps the company's brand fresh and newsworthy and sends a signal to their loyal customers that the company cares about them and their community.

          <h1 class="headerTypeOneLeft">Awareness and Credibility</h1>
          Being endorsed by an NGO display a company in a positive light. When an NGO endorses a brand, it creates more credibility than traditional media, where the public knows the company purchased its own advertising.  Brands with extensive portfolios might need to promote different divisions. The company Citybank has a lesser known division, Women & Company, who teaches females about financial literacy. In order to attract women business owners to this division Citybank might sponsor an NGO that advocates women empowerment and independence.
