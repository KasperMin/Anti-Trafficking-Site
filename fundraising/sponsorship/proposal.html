        The Sponsor Proposal
      </h1>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        When your NGO have figured out who to contact for a potential sponsorship and initiated the first contact it's time to send out the sponsor proposal. The sponsor proposal is very important since it entails all the arguments needed to convince a prospective sponsor to engage in a commercial partnership with your NGO. The following will explain how to write a sponsor proposal and what pitfalls to avoid.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>What is a Sponsor Proposal?</h3>
        <div id="menuOneMainBeforeList">
          The sponsor proposal, also referred to as the sponsorship deck or prospectus, is one of the most important documents in the sponsor game. Often a company's decisions about sponsorships – especially if it's a big one – are made in the company's team or committee where there won't be anyone who's representing your NGO present, only the sponsor proposal (Hollander, 2014). That's why the sponsor proposal need to be convincing enough to secure the sponsorship for your NGO. A sponsor proposal is:
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        "A pitch an individual/organization sends to another organization looking to establish a deal. In this document a partnership seeker needs to convince the investor of the worthiness of her/his project" (Optimy, 2017).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        A too common mistake is that the sponsor proposals ends up being a glorified company brochure, that are only focusing on the NGO. Effective sponsorship proposals inform the company about the NGO's property and clearly explains how it will add value to the company.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Corporate executives are very busy and have extremely limited time. Make the sponsor proposal easy to skim, with lots of headings, subheads, and bullets. For the sake of credibility make sure that it lives up to industry-standards. Always remember, that there is only one chance to make a good first impression (Candelaria, 2011).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>What to Include in a Sponsor Proposal?</h3>
        <h4>Cover Page</h4>
        The cover page states the name of your NGO's property, main sponsor benefits, and contact information. Include great graphics and a professional layout. The most compelling benefit, such as the buying power of your NGO's demographic, your NGO's credibility, or the strength of your NGO's program should appear here.  As emphasized earlier, the proposal is about the company not your NGO, so only use your NGO's tagline if it has a compelling benefit to the company.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Sponsor Goals</h4>
        It it's strongly encourage to start the sponsor proposal with goals for the prospective sponsor. This is the most important part for the company and it will make sure that they will keep reading. The objectives that your NGO have for them, might include educating people about their products and services, increasing brand loyalty, awareness, engagement opportunities, growing the customer base, and driving sales. Of course your NGO will have to customize the goals to each company.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Testimonials</h4>
        Praise and approval given from people outside of your NGO are powerful because they create credibility. Include full names of people endorsing your NGO if possible. In case confidentiality is an issue, use a pseudonym or an abbreviated name.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Sponsor Benefits</h4>
        In this section the company should be informed of all the benefits that your NGO will provide such as your assets, multi-benefits packages, and sponsor opportunities.

        <h4>Property Description</h4>
        Property Description: Explain in a few sentences who your NGO is, what it does, and why they should partner with you. It's a good idea to tell the company how your NGO is similar to promotions they have done in the past, since this is a way to match their preferences. But it's also important to explain how your NGO's property is unique. Research the company and let them know how your NGO's property supports its current initiatives, demographics, goals, and campaigns.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Founder's Story</h4>
        This is the story about the founder of your NGO or someone your NGO helped through an event or a project. The point of the story is to create an emotional connection which is an imperative element in getting people to sponsor your NGO. It's about being vulnerable and stand out from the other dry, boring sponsor proposals they receive (Hollander, 2014).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Property Story</h4>
        In extension to the founder's story your NGO can add the property story. Explain to the company how the epiphany or transformational experience, that lead to the creating the NGO has resulted in an event, program or another property. Elaborate on the property in this section.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Demographics</h4>
        Demographics are also referred to as target audience or target market, is one of the most valuable assets your NGO have. A common mistake made by NGOs, when making sponsor proposals, is to leave this part out (Hollander, 2014). This can be avoided by applying hard data such as age range, gender mix, education, income range, diversity, family status, occupation, life-cycle stage etc., to describe your NGO's demographics. Additionally, include psychographics and buying habits. These are all critical pieces of information to a potential sponsor.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Media Opportunities and Marketing Plan</h4>
         What most often separate NGOs who dream from NGOs who achieve are planning and implementation. How will people find out what your NGO does? This section doesn't need to be rigid and formal but merely a description how the word about the event, project, or organization will be spread and how the company will benefit. List your NGO's media partners and media that your NGO have been featured in. Explain how sponsors can be part of media campaigns.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h4>Call to Action</h4>
        The last section is where your NGO briefly restate the most compelling benefits and give the company instruction on how to proceed. There are different ways to go on from here but because a conversation with a "live" person is the best way to create rapport, having them call a phone number is advised. Make sure that there is someone to answer the phone professionally.
