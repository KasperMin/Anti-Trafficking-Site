        Approaching a Prospective Sponsor
      </h1>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        If your NGO have done the preliminary work of creating a strong vision and mission statement, made an attractive brand, identified a niche market, and screened for the most potential sponsorship prospects, then there is a strong foundation for starting to make contact. It cannot be overstated that the more meticulously these areas have been work on, the greater your NGO's chance will be in securing a sponsorship – and hopefully develop long-term partners (Tam, 2012).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>
          Where to Begin
        </h3>
        <div id="menuOneMainBeforeList">
          Before making a single call or sending out any e-mails make sure to be ready to follow up with the appropriate materials. It's also essential that your NGO's website/social media is tidy and updated, having sponsorship proposals and agreements on hand etc. If not, your NGO will come off as unorganized and unprofessional. Follow these steps to get started (Tam, 2012):
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Develop your branding, niche audience, and materials.
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Create a database of potential sponsors based on existing relationships, mutual contacts, and companies that fall outside your network but still relate to your market.
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Prioritize the list based on who can fulfill your priority needs, who you have the most connection with (especially established relationships), and who would be most interested in you. In other words, who you want to call first.
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            If you have multiple people working with you (such as a committee, board of directors, volunteers, staff, etc.), divide up the list by assigning those with the strongest personal connections to initiate contact.
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Do some basic research on the companies, their industry, their customers, etc. The more that you understand what their goals are, the better. There are many great tools available online for this including: Hoover’s, Duns & Bradstreet, Marketline/ Datamonitor, and LinkedIn. If you have contact names, you can use LinkedIn or do some basic searches to see if you can bring up conversational points.
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Begin contacting your list of potential sponsors based on this order. If you have a mutual connection, ask to have an introduction be made.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>How to Initiate Contact</h3>
        The best way for your NGO to make the initial contact to a sponsorship prospect depends on the relationship your NGO have with the company or the contact person.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        If you or someone in your NGO already have a well-established personal relationship with someone at a company, then it's best to be as up front as possible. Specifically ask if they have a process for sponsorship programs or co-branded marketing campaigns and what they would need in order to get your NGO's proposal reviewed. Ask additionally for insights about specific information they are looking for and that are important regarding their decision-making. If you or the person from your NGO feels uncomfortable with asking directly, there are a couple of more indirect ways to go about it (Tam, 2012):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li>
            See any current or past sponsorships: If the company is known for supporting other community events, bands, etc., try asking more about those past experiences and what they liked/ didn’t like about other sponsorship opportunities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offer marketing ideas, especially if they are tax deductible: Business owners are always looking for ways to expand their market presence, get exposure to new customers, and promote their products/ services. If you already have some creative ideas on how you can work together, ask for an appointment to go over some of your proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask if they’re passionate about charity or community events: Sometimes people will get involved with the arts, charity fundraisers, events, etc. on an individual level but not with their business. This might be a great opportunity to blend their personal passions with growing their business.
          </li>
        </ul>

        If your NGO don't have any relationship with the contact it can be a bit more difficult. That said, many new sponsorship deals are made without any prior contacts or working history. Here's a couple examples of how to approach the situation without having any direct relationship (Tam, 2012):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Have a mutual colleague introduce you: Scientists at the University of Milan have determined that the average number of acquaintances separating any two people in the world is 4.74. Odds are that you can find someone who can make an appropriate introduction to your prospect. Take advantage of social media tools and online research to see who can help you make the connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cold call: Many sales calls, sponsorships included, are done by simple cold calling (with no warm leads). Sometimes you just have to pick up the phone, send an email, or drop off a business card and use your elevator pitch to grab their attention. Don’t waste the postage mailing a packet without at least providing the personal touch.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>Who to contact</h3>
          When your NGO is going to pitch a sponsorship proposal, there are usually a couple of key people in the company, whom the person doing the pitch, will need to get in touch with. Browse the staff directory on the company's website, LinkedIn or use a search engine to retrieve contact information. In case this doesn't work, call the company and ask to be who to contact for sponsorships and marketing proposals. It will most likely be the following people, depending on the type of company (Tam, 2012):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sponsorship Manager or Artist Relations: If you are contacting a larger company that is already involved with sponsorships, they probably already have a sponsorships director or manager who leads reviewing sponsorship proposals.
          </li>
          <li>
            VP of Marketing or Director of Marketing: If a company doesn’t have a designated department for sponsorships, then the responsibility usually falls on the marketing department. Either way, you’ll eventually want to be working with marketing if you’d like to plan some co-branded campaigns or more creative endeavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brand Manager: These are individuals in charge of the P&L (Profit and loss) of the company affected by company loyalty. Pitching a sponsorship idea that can lift a company’s reputation with their target audiences would definitely be of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Director of Sales: Some companies combine sales and marketing into one department. In these instances, a sales executive or manager might be interested in hearing proposals that could expand their customer base.
          </li>
          <li>
            Business Owner: With most smaller, family-owned, local businesses, the buck stops here. They’re always interested in finding new ways to grow their business but might be more reluctant of financial risks, especially when there isn’t a clear return on investment. Often times though, if you have larger companies already supporting you, the business owner will be more interested.
