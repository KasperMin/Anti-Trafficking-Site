        Step 1: Identification – Screening Prospects
      </h1>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        The first step in the major gifts process is to identify individuals who your NGO is going to ask for a major gift. The best place to start looking, is in your NGO's current database of donors which are people who have already demonstrated interest in your organization and its cause.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>
          Biggest and Most Loyal Donors
        </h3>
        When searching your NGO's donor-database for the biggest donors it must be by cumulative measure, otherwise you might overlook donors who frequently makes small donations. Include every donation, including ticket purchases (event and raffle), responses to appeals, online gifts, etc., in your report (Eisenstein, 2014).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Loyal donors are another parameter to access when deciding who would be a prospective major gift giver. These are the donors who through the years have given continuously. A guideline would be people who have given seven or more times over the last ten years (Eisenstein, 2014). Keeping a list of loyal donors is important, even if they only have made small donations, because this is still shows that the donor is interested in your NGO. There can be a several reason why a donor gives small donation such as being a student, giving to multiple causes, temporary unemployment etc. With a little attention and VIP treatment this donor might become a major gift donor, over time (Eisenstein, 2014).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        With the calculator method in mind, use the 90/10 rule to prioritize your fundraising time and resources most effectively. The 90/10 rule prescribe that 90 percent of your NGO's fundraising income will be allocated from the top 10 percent of your donors, hence the majority of your fundraising effort should be target at those donors in the top 10 percent tier.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Fundraising is all about relationships which is the reason why it is imperative to spend time with someone from whom your NGO wants a major gift. Communicating by means of mail, e-mail and phone isn't enough. To raise major gifts, you will need to meet with all prospects in person. If, for some reason, this isn't possible, then video chat is a viable alternative.

        "One of the biggest mistakes that development staff members make when trying to fundraise from individuals is not keeping a list of specific prospects. Instead, they try to cultivate every single person they come in contact with" (Amy Eisenstein, 2014).

          Research: Getting to Know Your Donors
        </h3>
        A key parameter to successfully solicit major gifts is to have a great deal of information about the prospects – without crossing the line. This needs to be weight against your NGO's time and staff constrains. So, what is important to know about the donor? Here are a few cardinal points (Eisenstein, 2014):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Does your prospect have a high enough income or net worth to make a major gift?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            What kinds of assets does your prospect own?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Is your prospect philanthropically minded?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Is there anything in your prospect’s background that indicates a potential interest in your organization or in one or more of your specific programs? For example, has the prospect lost someone to cancer, or did the prospective overcome poverty or hardship to rise to the top of his or her profession?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Some of this information is available on the Internet while other information must be accessed via the donors themselves. Online sites like linkedin.com, Zillow.com, Salary.com and salary.com are useful place to start but don't spend too much time on this this type of research.  The best way to get the needed information is by asking the donor personally (Eisenstein, 2014; Greenhoe, 2013).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <h3>
          Preparing the Prospect for your Call
        </h3>
        In order to get the information in person, a meeting must be set up. This should preferably be conducted through a phone call. Making a call is actually one of the most undesired activities amongst volunteers, development officers and fundraisers.

        There are several reason why volunteers and even fundraising professional feels at unease making this call, even though they aren't going to ask for money. It has to do with the expectations about what the prospect might think when receiving the call, for example the fact that people are busy and they are receiving calls from all kinds of different companies who wants to sell them something.         To overcome this barrier, it helps to understand the mindset of the prospect. It's very like that the prospect will think one or more of the following thoughts (Greenhoe, 2013):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Does your prospect have a high enough income or net worth to make a major gift?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Why is this person calling me?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            What is this person selling?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            What's in it for me?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Do I have time to talk to this person?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            This better be quick.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        By being prepared you can get around this challenge. Sending a letter, postcard or even an e-mail beforehand is a way to "warm up" the prospect. The point is to give the prospect advance notice the they will be contacted by phone. A letter is a good way to go since it make your NGO stand out in today's electronically communication driven society. It also signals effort and thus importance and thoughtfulness, since you have to write it, put it in an envelope, and send it. Leaving the impression that you are respectful and sincere removes some of the above mentioned questions the prospect might have.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Depending on how you look at fundraising it can mean different things. One way of looking at fundraising is that it is essentially about parring core values up with opportunities. In other words, it is presenting a donor with an opportunity to support something that they really care about (Perry & Schreifels, 2014). Remember, people are only irritated with companies trying to sell them something that they don't need.

          Calling prospects
        </h3>
        Making time to call prospects during the workday and having a calling strategy is important. Because people are busy it might take several calls getting the prospect to answer. It might sound like a lot, but making at least seven calls before crossing a prospect off the list is recommended. This should be done with a frequency of one call per week in order not to harass the prospect.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        During the phone conversation the objective is to lower the hesitations that the prospect might have regarding meeting your fundraiser. One way of achieving this is to assure them of the benefits they will enjoy from a meeting. What that exactly is varies from person to person but a general approach is to hint at some of the exciting things happening at your NGO, without going into detail (Greenhoe, 2013). The point of the phone call is to secure a meeting by intriguing the prospects and save the exact details for the meeting.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Another important aspect is to make the meeting convenient, not only for the prospect, but also for the fundraiser. If it seems like your NGO is going out of their way to make the meeting happen, it might put a lot of pressure on the prospect which will increase the likelihood of the prospect declining to meet. Making the meeting appear as "no big deal" could come in the shape of "the fundraiser is going to be in the neighborhood of where the prospect work next week" or something like that, so it would be convenient to drop by.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        The best place to meet the first time is wherever the prospect will meet your fundraiser. Even if the prospect suggests locations where there might be interruptions, the best approach would be to deal with those issues, to the best of one's abilities, and then scheduling the next meeting at a less hectic location.
