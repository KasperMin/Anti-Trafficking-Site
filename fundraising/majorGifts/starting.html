        Before the Major Gift Cycle: How to get started?
      </h1>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        The first thing your NGO needs to do when before starting looking for major gifts, is to make an honest and accurate assessment of whether or not your NGO has the essential prerequisites for a successful major gifts program, in place.  Here are 4 question to help making that assessment (Parrish & Walters, 2016):
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        <div id="menuOneMainBeforeList">
          Before making a single call or sending out any e-mails make sure to be ready to follow up with the appropriate materials. It's also essential that your NGO's website/social media is tidy and updated, having sponsorship proposals and agreements on hand etc. If not, your NGO will come off as unorganized and unprofessional. Follow these steps to get started (Tam, 2012):
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Are you meeting your annual needs?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Do you have the infrastructure, the staff, the CRM software, etc. to handle major gifts?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            Do you have donors on your horizon who might be cultivated into becoming major gifts donors?
          </li>
          <li id="menuOneList">
            How has your organization maintained and fulfilled restricted gifts you’ve had in the past?
          </li>
        </ul>

          How Much is your NGO's Major Gift Level?
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        The answer to this question depends on your NGO, since, what exactly constitutes as a major gift in one NGO, might not be considered a Major Gift in another NGO. At University X, a Major Gift might be any gift above $25.000 while $100.000 might be the bar to cross at University Y. So how does your NGO decide what constitutes as a Major Gift?
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        A rule of thumb is to make sure that the major gift is more than the average gift. It can be a bit tricky to decided what constitutes as being significantly larger than the average donation. If your NGO never have received a gift above $1000 then $25.000 is probably too big of stretch. It would be more realistic to begin with $5000 or even less.

        Using your NGO's database is a good way to get started. Begin by singling out ten donors who have made the biggest donations but exclude corporation and foundations. Look at each of those donor's separately and add each of their donations together so you get the cumulative – or total – amount (Eisenstein, 2014).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        For example, if one of the selected donors donated $1.000 online, came to your NGO's gala where tickets were priced at $300, and bought a raffle ticket worth $200, then the cumulative giving that year would be $1.500 for that particular donor.
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        Do most of your NGO's top donors fall into the same range $1000-$5000, or are there a few outliers? If a couple of the donors have a cumulative giving of $5000 or more and your second or thirds biggest donor gave only $800, then such factors plays into deciding on the size of your NGO's major-gift level.

          The Calculator Method: How many?
        </h3>
          In reaching your NGO's overall objectives as well as financial goals, defining how much constitutes as a major gift doesn't get you all the way there. An ostensibly obvious prerequisite is to have clearly defined goals. If your NGO is unclear on which programs and operations you need to finance, it is difficult to determine how much your NGO need to raise and hence how many major donors you need to ask.

        Having decided on how much your NGO needs to raise and how much major gifts should account for, in conjunction with alternative revenue streams, the next step is to determine how many major gifts your NGO need to raise. If your NGO, in any given year, aims to raise $100.000 there is an empirical proven best practice to do this – the calculator method (baker et.al, 2014).
      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
        The intuitive way might be to find one hundred people who each will donate $1000. But the most effective way is actually to receive one gift that accounts for 10-25% of the total amount. The next should account for 7-15% of the total amount. The two after that should account for 5-10% of the total amount and so forth, until your each 100%. This is the basic principle of the calculator method. An online calculator-tool can be found at:

      </div>
      <div class="menuOneMainTextPara">
      This is a fairly simple approach and because of its simplicity it isn't flawless (baker et.al, 2014).  But it is a helpful tool to shape your NGO's approach to major gift fundraising. The gift calculator-tool provided above also includes how many prospects your NGO needs in order to secure a given amount at each gift range.
